# FiddleMokk

While working through my UX certification, I kept running into the same wall: traditional design tools felt detached from the real thing. As a software engineer, I wanted a workflow where what I sketch is already halfway to production—something I could rebuild in code without friction.

So I made FiddleMokk.

It’s an HTML-based lo-fi and hi-fi mockup tool built to feel natural, fast, and a little addictive. TailwindCSS, FiddleMokkCSS, Google Fonts, and Material Icons come together under a clean, deliberate structure that lets you shape layouts the way they’re meant to behave.

Most mockup apps dress themselves up as “lo-fi” or “hi-fi,” but underneath they’re just vector canvases pretending to understand interfaces. FiddleMokk is built for flow, not decoration. It already handles multi-page designs smoothly, and I’m currently adding HTML export and snapshot generation so every layout you make can slide straight into real projects. More refinements are on the way.

For many, this kind of foundation might seem more complex. For me, it’s seamless.

## Education

Even though FiddleMokk was created for mockups, it’s far from limited to them.

The interface intentionally echoes the structure of real HTML. The **Divvy** section is shaped to feel familiar—even if users aren’t writing code directly, they’re brushing against the rhythms of markup as they build. The goal is to ease people into understanding the structure behind the screens they create, quietly dissolving the hesitation that usually surrounds code.

FiddleMokk turns that exposure into something approachable, intuitive, and just a touch daring.
